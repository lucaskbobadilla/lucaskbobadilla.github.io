  Waterhemp [*Amaranthus tuberculatus* (Moq.) Sauer] is one of the most troublesome weed species in the midwestern United States. *Amaranthus tuberculatus* has prolific seed production and can drastically reduce soybean and corn yields by 40% to 70%, respectively. The rapid evolution and selection of herbicide-resistance traits in A. tuberculatus represent a major challenge in managing this species. Amaranthus tuberculatus resistant to acetolactate synthase (ALS) and photosystem II (PSII) inhibitors was first identified in the 1990s; currently, resistance to herbicides from seven SOA groups (Groups 2, 4, 5, 9, 14, 15, 27) has been documented.
  
  Dicamba is a synthetic auxin herbicide that has been commercially available since the late 1960s to control a wide range of broadleaf weeds. Dicamba is an important herbicide in corn production and also in soybean following the release of dicamba-resistant soybean cultivars. 
  
  This project has the focus the characterization of first documented dicamba resistance case in *Amaranthus tuberculatus*. The project was divided into two steps:
  
* Step 1: **Quantification of the resistance level and understanding of the inheritance patterns**

This step was recently [published](https://lucaskbobadilla.github.io/publication/bobadilla-characterization-inheritance-dicamba-2022/) on Weed Science and details can be found in the peer reviewed manuscript. In fact, the paper was featured in the cover of the journal edition and was [featured in multiple News outlet](https://aces.illinois.edu/news/first-dicamba-resistant-waterhemp-reported-illinois).

* Step 2: **Transcriptome and expression variation in Dicamba resistance waterhemp**

This second step consists of an RNA-seq study to identify the putative candidate genes involved with dicamba resistance. Currently, I already identified key genes that could play a role in dicamba resistance and a manuscript is on the writing process.
