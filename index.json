Amaranthus tuberculatus has prolific seed production and can drastically reduce soybean and corn yields by 40% to 70%, respectively. The rapid evolution and selection of herbicide-resistance traits in A. tuberculatus represent a major challenge in managing this species. Amaranthus tuberculatus resistant to acetolactate synthase (ALS) and photosystem II (PSII) inhibitors was first identified in the 1990s; currently, resistance to herbicides from seven SOA groups (Groups 2, 4, 5, 9, 14, 15, 27) has been documented.\nDicamba is a synthetic auxin herbicide that has been commercially available since the late 1960s to control a wide range of broadleaf weeds. Dicamba is an important herbicide in corn production and also in soybean following the release of dicamba-resistant soybean cultivars.\nThis project has the focus the characterization of first documented dicamba resistance case in Amaranthus tuberculatus. The project was divided into two steps:\n Step 1: Quantification of the resistance level and understanding of the inheritance patterns  This step was recently published on Weed Science and details can be found in the peer reviewed manuscript. In fact, the paper was featured in the cover of the journal edition and was featured in multiple News outlet.\n Step 2: Transcriptome and expression variation in Dicamba resistance waterhemp  This second step consists of an RNA-seq study to identify the putative candidate genes involved with dicamba resistance. Currently, I already identified key genes that could play a role in dicamba resistance and a manuscript is on the writing process.\n","date":1650839525,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1650839525,"objectID":"6ccea573c3cc9e4333f4f7629c34ab92","permalink":"https://lucaskbobadilla.github.io/project/dicamba/","publishdate":"2022-04-24T17:32:05-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/dicamba/","section":"project","summary":"Characterization of the first dicamba resistance waterhemp","tags":["Weed Science","herbicide resistance","RNA-seq","dicamba"],"title":"Dicamba resistance evolution in Amaranthus tuberculatus","type":"project"},{"authors":["Lucas K.

Sauer] is one of the most troublesome agronomic weeds in the midwestern United States. The rapid evolution and selection of herbicide-resistance traits in A. tuberculatus is a major challenge in managing this species. An A. tuberculatus population, designated CHR, was identified in 2012 in Champaign County, IL, and previously characterized as resistant to herbicides from six site-of-action groups: 2,4-D (Group 4), acetolactate synthase inhibitors (Group 2), protoporphyrinogen oxidase inhibitors (Group 14), 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase inhibitors (Group 27), photosystem II inhibitors (Group 5), and very-long-chain fatty-acid synthesis inhibitors (Group 15). Recently, ineffective control of CHR was observed in the field after dicamba application. Therefore, this research was initiated to confirm dicamba resistance, quantify the resistance level, and investigate its inheritance in CHR. Multiple field trials were conducted at the CHR location to confirm poor control with dicamba and compare dicamba treatments with other herbicides. Greenhouse trials were conducted to quantify the resistance level in CHR and confirm genetic inheritance of the resistance. In field trials, dicamba did not provide more than 65% control, while glyphosate and glufosinate provided at least 90% control. Multiple accessions were generated from controlled crosses and evaluated in greenhouse trials. Greenhouse dicamba dose– response experiments indicated a resistance level of 5- to 10-fold relative to a sensitive parental line. Dose– response experiments using F1 lines indicated that dicamba resistance was an incompletely dominant trait. Segregation analysis with F2 and backcross populations indicated that dicamba resistance had moderate heritability and was potentially a multigenic trait. Although dicamba resistance was predominantly inherited as a nuclear trait, minor maternal inheritance was not completely ruled out. To our knowledge, CHR is one of the first cases of dicamba resistance in A. tuberculatus. Further studies will focus on elucidating the genes involved in dicamba resistance.","tags":["dicamba","weed Science","waterhemp"],"title":"Characterization and Inheritance of Dicamba Resistance in a Multiple-Resistant Waterhemp (emphAmaranthusemph Tuberculatus) Population from Illinois","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcelo L.

This study's objective was to characterize the response of GR, GPR, and glyphosate/paraquat– susceptible (GPS) biotypes of both weed species to herbicides with a different SOA. Whole-plant dose– response bioassays indicated a similar response among tested biotypes of both weed species to rimsulfuron, dicamba, hexazinone, glufosinate, flumioxazin, saflufenacil, or mesotrione. The hairy fleabane GR and GPR biotypes were 2.7- and 2.9-fold resistant to 2,4-D relative to the GPS biotype (GR50 766.7 g ai ha– 1), confirming 2,4-D resistance in hairy fleabane for the first time in California. The GR and GPR biotypes were not cross-resistant to dicamba. No differences in response to 2,4-D were observed among horseweed biotypes with a GR50 ranging from 150.2 to 277.4 g ai ha– 1. The GPR biotypes of both species were cross-resistant to diquat, with a 44.0-fold resistance in hairy fleabane (GR50 863.7 g ai ha– 1) and 15.6-fold resistance in horseweed (GR50 563.1 g ai ha– 1). The confirmation of multiple resistances to glyphosate, paraquat, and 2,4-D in hairy fleabane curtails herbicide SOA alternatives and jeopardizes resistance management strategies based on herbicide rotation and tank mixtures, underscoring the critical need for nonchemical weed control alternatives.","tags":["2","4-D","Conyza bonariensis (L.)

Husnot] is one of the most troublesome weeds worldwide. L. multiflorum is also a grass seed crop cultivated on 50,000 ha in Oregon, where both diploid and tetraploid cultivars are grown. A survey was conducted to understand the distribution, frequency, and susceptibility of L. multiflorum to selected herbicides used to control L. multiflorum. The herbicides selected were clethodim, glufosinate, glyphosate, mesosulfuron-methyl (mesosulfuron), paraquat, pinoxaden, pyroxsulam, quizalofop-P-ethyl (quizolafop), pronamide, flufenacet + metribuzin, and pyroxasulfone. The ploidy levels of the populations were also tested. A total of 150 fields were surveyed between 2017 and 2018, of which 75 (50%) had L. multiflorum present. Herbicide-resistant populations were documented in 88% of the 75 populations collected. The most frequent mechanisms of action were resistance to Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase), Acetolactate Synthase (ALS), 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSPs) inhibitors, and combinations thereof. Multiple and cross-resistance, found in 75% of the populations, were the most frequent patterns of resistance. Paraquat-resistant biotypes were confirmed in six orchard crop populations for the first time in Oregon. Herbicide resistance was spatially clustered, with most cases of resistance in the northern part of the surveyed area. ALS and ACCase resistant populations were prevalent in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) fields. Multiple-resistance was positively correlated with plant density. Tetraploid feral populations were identified, but no cases of herbicide resistance were documented. This is the first survey of herbicide resistance and ploidy diversity in L. multiflorum in western Oregon. Resistant populations were present across the surveyed area, indicating that the problem is widespread.","tags":["cross-resistance","multiple-resistance","ploidy level","Spatial analysis","survey"],"title":"Frequency, Distribution, and Ploidy Diversity of Herbicide-Resistant Italian Ryegrass (emphLoliumemph Perenne Spp. emphMultiflorum) Populations of Western Oregon","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephen O Duke","Ian Heap","Patrick J Tranel","Lucas Kopecky Bobadilla"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1650828415,"objectID":"06bdf06c295774eae9597a35fc1ed0d8","permalink":"https://lucaskbobadilla.github.io/publication/duke-how-many-ways-2021/","publishdate":"2022-04-24T19:26:55.163692Z","relpermalink":"/publication/duke-how-many-ways-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Weeding has been the bane of humanity since the dawn of agriculture. For about 70 years, synthetic herbicides have removed much of the drudgery of this onerous task. Glyphosate was introduced as a non-selective herbicide in 1974. Its ideal properties made it a very popular herbicide, and the introduction of glyphosate-resistant (GR) crops allowed its use as a selective herbicide, greatly expanding its use to become the most used herbicide on earth. For farmers who used glyphosate in GR crops, it was the golden age of weed management, as this technology significantly improved the efficacy and reduced the cost of weed management. Weed management was also simplified, an asset that was particularly valuable to part-time farmers. Furthermore, this technology provided the environmental benefits (reduced soil loss and fossil fuel use) of significantly reducing tillage. Farmers saved billions of US$, and weed management became more effective and simple. Indeed, to many farmers, glyphosate with GR crops became the goose that laid the golden egg. After more than 20 years of use, the first cases of GR weeds were reported in the latter 1990s. After a lag period of less than 10 years after the first GR weed was reported, the number of species reported to have evolved glyphosate resistance began to increase in a linear fashion, reaching 53 species in 2021, third only to atrazine (66 species), a much older herbicide and to ALS inhibitors (168 species), which include several different herbicides used in numerous crops since the 1980s. The long lag phase before any resistance was detected led some to believe by the mid-1990s that evolution of resistance was improbable. By this time, glyphosate use was greatly increasing, especially in GR crops, an ideal situation for the evolution of resistance. After this, the number of glyphosate-resistance cases exploded, and the mechanisms of resistance to many of these cases of resistance were determined. A recent, short commentary detailed these mechanisms after a new mechanism of resistance was reported. The number of mechanisms for resistance to no other herbicide comes close to those of glyphosate. In the present paper, we briefly describe the many evolved mechanisms by which weeds have evolved resistance to glyphosate.","tags":[],"title":"How Many Ways Can Nature Kill the Goose That Laid the Golden Egg?–The Many Mechanisms of Evolved Glyphosate Resistance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lucas K.

Oregon tall fescue seed production requires high seed purity, demanding good control of Italian ryegrass. The necessity to control herbicide-resistant Italian ryegrass and maintain tall fescue seed purity created interest in new chemical management options. The objectives of this study were to assess the effects of synthetic auxin herbicides on seed viability of Italian ryegrass biotypes and the feasibility of this management strategy for use in tall fescue seed production. Eight treatments of synthetic auxin herbicides were applied to Italian ryegrass and tall fescue at two growth stages (boot and anthesis): dicamba (1.0 and 2.2 kg ae ha–1), 2,4-D (1.1 and 2.2 kg ae ha–1), aminopyralid (0.5 kg ae ha–1), dicamba + 2.4-D (0.8 + 1.1 kg ae ha–1), 2.4-D + clopyralid (1.1 + 0.3 kg ae ha–1), and halauxifen-methyl + florasulam (0.4 kg ae ha–1 + 0.4 kg ai ha–1). Aminopyralid applied at boot and anthesis stages of Italian ryegrass reduced seed viability. Aminopyralid treatments reduced seed viability and weight of Italian ryegrass more than 50% compared to the control. Four biotypes from different locations in western Oregon with different types of herbicide resistance were sprayed, and differences in aminopyralid effect among Italian ryegrass biotypes were documented. Aminopyralid reduced the speed of germination by 1 to 2 d. Aminopyralid treatments had a greater effect when applied at the anthesis stage and had a greater negative impact on tall fescue. Tall fescue plants were more susceptible to aminopyralid, so this management practice is not feasible for tall fescue seed production. Future studies are needed to understand the physiological mechanisms involved in the reduced seed viability and to define an optimum aminopyralid rate for different Italian ryegrass biotypes.","tags":[],"title":"Application of Synthetic Auxin Herbicides to Suppress Seed Viability of Italian Ryegrass (Lolium Perenne ssp.
