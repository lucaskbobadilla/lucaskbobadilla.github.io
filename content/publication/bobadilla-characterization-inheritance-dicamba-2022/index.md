abstract: 'Waterhemp [Amaranthus tuberculatus (Moq.) Sauer] is one of the most troublesome
  agronomic weeds in the midwestern United States. The rapid evolution and selection
  of herbicide-resistance traits in A. tuberculatus is a major challenge in managing
  this species. An A. tuberculatus population, designated CHR, was identified in 2012
  in Champaign County, IL, and previously characterized as resistant to herbicides
  from six site-of-action groups: 2,4-D (Group 4), acetolactate synthase inhibitors
  (Group 2), protoporphyrinogen oxidase inhibitors (Group 14), 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate
  dioxygenase inhibitors (Group 27), photosystem II inhibitors (Group 5), and very-long-chain
  fatty-acid synthesis inhibitors (Group 15). Recently, ineffective control of CHR
  was observed in the field after dicamba application. Therefore, this research was
  initiated to confirm dicamba resistance, quantify the resistance level, and investigate
  its inheritance in CHR. Multiple field trials were conducted at the CHR location
  to confirm poor control with dicamba and compare dicamba treatments with other herbicides.
  Greenhouse trials were conducted to quantify the resistance level in CHR and confirm
  genetic inheritance of the resistance. In field trials, dicamba did not provide
  more than 65% control, while glyphosate and glufosinate provided at least 90% control.
  Multiple accessions were generated from controlled crosses and evaluated in greenhouse
  trials. Greenhouse dicamba dose– response experiments indicated a resistance level
  of 5- to 10-fold relative to a sensitive parental line. Dose– response experiments
  using F1 lines indicated that dicamba resistance was an incompletely dominant trait.
  Segregation analysis with F2 and backcross populations indicated that dicamba resistance
  had moderate heritability and was potentially a multigenic trait. Although dicamba
  resistance was predominantly inherited as a nuclear trait, minor maternal inheritance
  was not completely ruled out. To our knowledge, CHR is one of the first cases of
  dicamba resistance in A. tuberculatus. Further studies will focus on elucidating
  the genes involved in dicamba resistance.'
