abstract: Italian ryegrass [Lolium perenne L. spp. multiflorum (Lam.) Husnot] is one
  of the most troublesome weeds worldwide. L. multiflorum is also a grass seed crop
  cultivated on 50,000 ha in Oregon, where both diploid and tetraploid cultivars are
  grown. A survey was conducted to understand the distribution, frequency, and susceptibility
  of L. multiflorum to selected herbicides used to control L. multiflorum. The herbicides
  selected were clethodim, glufosinate, glyphosate, mesosulfuron-methyl (mesosulfuron),
  paraquat, pinoxaden, pyroxsulam, quizalofop-P-ethyl (quizolafop), pronamide, flufenacet
  + metribuzin, and pyroxasulfone. The ploidy levels of the populations were also
  tested. A total of 150 fields were surveyed between 2017 and 2018, of which 75 (50%)
  had L. multiflorum present. Herbicide-resistant populations were documented in 88%
  of the 75 populations collected. The most frequent mechanisms of action were resistance
  to Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase), Acetolactate Synthase (ALS), 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate
  (EPSPs) inhibitors, and combinations thereof. Multiple and cross-resistance, found
  in 75% of the populations, were the most frequent patterns of resistance. Paraquat-resistant
  biotypes were confirmed in six orchard crop populations for the first time in Oregon.
  Herbicide resistance was spatially clustered, with most cases of resistance in the
  northern part of the surveyed area. ALS and ACCase resistant populations were prevalent
  in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) fields. Multiple-resistance was positively correlated
  with plant density. Tetraploid feral populations were identified, but no cases of
  herbicide resistance were documented. This is the first survey of herbicide resistance
  and ploidy diversity in L. multiflorum in western Oregon. Resistant populations
  were present across the surveyed area, indicating that the problem is widespread.
