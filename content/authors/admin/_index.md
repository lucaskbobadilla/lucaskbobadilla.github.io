I am a weed scientist and computational biologist PhD candidate at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu). My research focuses on the use of computational biology to understand weeds adaptation in agricultural environments mainly studying herbicide resistance evolution. My work involves the use of multiple "omics" tools, high throughput phenotyping using image analysis, machine learning and data science. My research goal is to continue using high throughput data to answer key questions that will increase agriculture efficiency and sustainability.

On my free time, I love spend time with my daughter, wife and dog. I enjoy learning new programming languages and to play with data.
